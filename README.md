### Project Portfolio Machine Learning - Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)

I performed EDA on a salary dataset from Kaggle, which explores the relationship between years of experience and salary. The dataset provides insights into how experience impacts earning potential, and I used it to build and evaluate machine learning regression models.

The dataset is available at this link: [Salary Dataset - Simple Linear Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression).

### Analysis Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing the relationship between experience and salary.
   - Understanding the distribution and summary statistics of the data.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Check for Duplicates**: Ensured no duplicate records were present.
   - **Check for Missing Values**: Verified that the dataset had no missing values.
   - **Outlier Analysis**: Identified and handled outliers to improve model performance.

3. **Machine Learning Modelling**
   - Built and evaluated three regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Models were evaluated using R-Squared, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (Salary) that can be explained by the independent variable (Experience).
